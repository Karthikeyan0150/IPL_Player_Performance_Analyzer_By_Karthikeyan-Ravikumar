# IPL_Player_Performance_Analyzer_By_Karthikeyan-Ravikumar
The IPL Player Performance Analyzer is a dynamic Excel-based dashboard project designed to evaluate and compare player performance in the Indian Premier League (IPL). 
The project uses structured player statistics (batting and bowling) to identify top performers across various metrics such as runs, strike rate, wickets, and economy rate.
The project allows users to explore player stats across teams and seasons using PivotTables, interactive filters.
Visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs offer deep insights into team contributions and individual excellence.
